We are 5 undergraduate students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the United States. We are working with Ashtanga Berlin to design a climate action game design this spring. This survey will consist of a carbon calculator trial and a set of accompanying questions. The questions will ask for your perspective on environmental sustainability, community, and climate change. Your participation will help us gain valuable data about how the public views climate change. In order to complete the survey, please give your consent below by typing your full name in the box and entering your name in the second box. Consent indicates your willingness to participate in the carbon calculator and set of questions. Your responses to both the carbon calculator and survey will be anonymous, as no identifying data will be stored. 

If you have any questions or concerns about this session, please email gr-climateactionberlin25@wpi.edu.
